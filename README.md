# Vision-23
Our final submission code for Vision 2023 conducted by Robotics Club, IIT(BHU)

## Approach
We assumed a color-order for the bot to detect the ball and shoot the respective humanoid with. Assuming we start with yellow, the bot will rotate in place till it detects a yellow ball. Once it aligns with the camera center, the bot stops rotating and starts moving towards it. Once within reach, the bot catches the ball and then again rotates in position to look for the pole. On finding the pole, the bot moves towards the pole. Once there, it again rotates to find the corresponding humanoid, shoots it, and then repeats the same process for the other colors.
